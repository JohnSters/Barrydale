# Barrydale Tourism App - Brainstorming

## Overview
- Tourism app focused on small towns, starting with Barrydale, South Africa
- Subscription-based model where users can add businesses, shops, and attractions
- Web application with companion mobile app

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Proposed: C#, .NET 8, WebAssembly (Blazor)
#### Benefits:
- **Unified Language**: Full-stack development in C# reduces context switching
- **Performance**: WebAssembly enables near-native performance in the browser
- **Strong Typing**: Compile-time checking reduces runtime errors
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Mature libraries and tooling
- **Authentication**: Built-in identity solutions with ASP.NET Core Identity
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core provides robust data access
- **SignalR**: Real-time communication capabilities for notifications and updates
- **Hosting**: Easy deployment to Azure or other cloud providers
- **Offline Support**: Blazor has PWA templates with offline capabilities

#### WebAssembly's Role:
- Allows running C# code directly in the browser through Blazor WebAssembly
- Provides rich interactivity without server roundtrips
- Enables offline functionality when combined with service workers
- Near-native performance for complex UI operations

#### Considerations:
- Initial download size can be larger than JavaScript frameworks
- Cold start performance considerations
- Limited browser debugging compared to JavaScript

### Alternative Stacks to Consider:

#### 1. JavaScript/TypeScript Based:
- **React/Next.js + Node.js/Express**
  - Larger developer community
  - Extensive component libraries
  - Better SEO with server-side rendering
  - Lighter initial payload

- **Vue.js/Nuxt.js + Firebase**
  - Quick setup with less boilerplate
  - Built-in authentication, database, and hosting
  - Serverless architecture reduces maintenance

#### 2. Cross-Platform Frameworks:
- **Flutter Web + Dart**
  - Single codebase for web and mobile
  - Excellent performance and UI consistency
  - Rich animation capabilities

#### 3. Other .NET Options:
- **Blazor Server**
  - Smaller initial download
  - Better for low-powered devices
  - Server resources for complex operations
  - But: Requires constant connection

## Mobile Integration Strategy

### Ionic/Capacitor + Web API
- **Approach**: 
  - RESTful or GraphQL API built with ASP.NET Core
